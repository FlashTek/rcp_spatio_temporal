This folder contains the final code used in the bachelor's thesis of Roland Zimmermann.
While in this level the base code and utility methods are stored, the folders "barkley", "bocf" and "mitchell" contain the implementation of the
excitable (chaotic) systems. The folder "final" contains the final code of the cross prediction, the unblurring approach and the
outer -> inner prediciton.
